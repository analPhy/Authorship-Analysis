Identify and sort n-grams (unigram to trigram) in order of frequency in multiple datasets. Compare number of ngrams occurring in both Q and K datasets based on steps of n ngrams where the default for n is 20. Compare the first 20, next 20 and continue until top 200. Comparison should be available incrementally and sequentially The number of shared ngrams at each step should be listed. The system should automatically select the best match if any.
